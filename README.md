# Error-detection-and-correction-by-hamming-code
This project is all about transmitting message bits and checking if it has errors or not. 
Whether it has errors, the hamming code is going to fix it. In this project, we have implemented an algorithm that is faster than the classic Hamming code 
and it works with single-bit errors. Besides, We compared both classic and improved hamming code. 
This code is famous for its single-bit error detection & correction capability.
